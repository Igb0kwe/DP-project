			<dt>HOW DOES A COMPUTER VIRUS SPREAD?</dt><br>
			<dd><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The distinguishing characteristic of a virus is it spreads from system to system after a user takes some action that either intentionally or accidentally facilitates that spread. This spread is known as virus propagation, and there are many different techniques viruses can use to propagate between systems. The simplest example occurs when a virus is contained within an executable file that a user downloads from the internet, receives in an email message or copies from a removable storage device. As soon as the user executes that file, the virus springs into action, running malicious code that infects the user's system.<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other viruses can spread through more complex mechanisms. In those cases, a virus running on an infected system may take action to begin its own propagation. For example, a virus might copy itself to all removable media installed on a system, attach itself to email messages sent to a user's contacts or copy itself to shared file servers. In those cases, the lines become blurred between viruses, which require human assistance to spread, and worms, which spread on their own by exploiting vulnerabilities. The key difference is the virus will always require a human to take an action that enables that final step in the propagation process, while a worm does not require this human assistance.<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Viruses can also spread between systems without ever writing data to disk, making them more difficult to detect with virus protection and virus removal mechanisms. These fileless viruses are often launched when a user visits an infected website and then run completely within the target system's memory, carrying out their malicious payload and then disappearing without a trace.
